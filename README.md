# NodeJS

## Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment

* Open Source - Source code is publically available for sharing and modification
* Cross Platform - Available on Mac, Windows and Linux  
* JavaScript Runtime Environment - It provides all the required components such as JavaScript Engine and other required apis to run JavaScript

### Chrome's V8 Engine

* Chrome's V8 Engine (JavaScript Engine) by Google sits at the core of Node.js
* Chrome's V8 is written in C++ and used in Chrome browser
* By embedding V8 into your own C++ application (example: chrome), you can write C++ code that gets executed when user writes JavaScript code
* Since C++ is great for lower level operations like file-handling, database connection and network operations, by embedding V8 into your own C++ program (example: Node.js) you have all the power to add all of that functionality in JavaScript
